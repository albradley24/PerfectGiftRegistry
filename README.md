# PerfectGiftRegistry

Class project completed and added onto throughout the course of the semester.

Users should be able to log on to the website to add, edit, and delete items to/from their gift registry.
Users can provide access to specific people - who can look up gift ideas for that particular person.
Forms should have spell check, email validation, and empty field checks.
Dashboard should show detailed information about the gift the user is requesting (in some cases images/links).
Functionality should be built in where users can pick an item to "check off" the list and it will no longer be visible to others - this means the gift has already been purchased.
